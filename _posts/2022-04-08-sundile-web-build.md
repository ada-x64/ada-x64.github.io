I recently uploaded a test build for sundile which shows off the fact that it runs on the web.

Right now everything is in a prototype phase - for instance, the terrain generator is embarrassingly under-performant and under-featured. But this is a proof-of-concept and Iâ€™m still quite happy with it. Sundile on the web!
