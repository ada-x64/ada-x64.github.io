Hi, I'm Ada! I'm a software developer living in Kansas and looking for work.

I'm passionate about game and tools development and am a strong proponent of open-source software.
In particular, I have experience writing game engines and web software by using and contributing to open-source tools.

You can download my resume [here.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Ada-Mandala-Resume.pdf)

I'm also on [Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/ada_x64)

# Projects

## [Sundile](https://github.com/ada-x64/sundile_rs)
[Check out the web build!](https://ada-x64.itch.io/sundile-wasm-test)

Sundile is a modular and extensible game framework written in the Rust programming langauge. It builds both natively and to the web, and is in active development.

For a more technical overview, feel free to peruse the repository. I try to document as much as I can.

## [Quell](https://github.com/ada-x64/quell)
I'm making Sundile so I can make Quell.

Quell is a procedurally generated open-world rougelike with a strong focus on narrative, drawing heavily on my studies in philosophy.
Quell has been in development for over two years now, split between philosophical research, development on Sundile, and the parenting of my child.
