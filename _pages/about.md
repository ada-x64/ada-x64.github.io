Hi, I'm Ada! I'm a software developer living in Kansas and looking for work.

You can download my resume [here.]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Ada-Mandala-Resume.pdf)

# Projects

## [Sundile](https://github.com/ada-x64/sundile_rs)
[Check out the web build!](https://ada-x64.itch.io/sundile_wasm_build)

Sundile is a modular and extensible game framework written in the Rust programming langauge. It builds both natively and to the web, and is in active development.

## [Quell](https://github.com/ada-x64/quell)
I'm making Sundile so I can make Quell.

Quell is an procedurally generated open-world rougelike with a strong focus on narrative, drawing heavily on my studies in philosophy.
